PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW

1. Core Framework & Build Tool
--------------------------------------
- React (v19): The main library used to build the user interface (UI).
- Vite: The build tool and development server used to run and bundle the app.

2. UI & User Experience Features
--------------------------------------
- Intro Sequence: 
  * A custom "Intro" component that plays a cinematic animation when the app first loads.
  * Displays the branding before seamlessly transitioning to the login screen.

- Interactive Lamp Login:
  * A unique, interactive login screen where the user must "pull" a virtual lamp cord to turn on the lights.
  * This interaction reveals the Google Sign-In card, adding a playful and premium feel to the entry experience.
  * Built using CSS animations and Framer Motion for the drag physics.

- Emojis:
  * using 'emoji-picker-react': A dedicated library that provides the extensive emoji keyboard used in the chat.
  
- Avatars:
  * User avatars are primarily pulled from their Google Profiles upon sign-in.
  * Fallback avatars utilize 'Flaticon' defaults (e.g., standard user icons) when a user doesn't have a profile picture.

3. Backend Services (Firebase)
--------------------------------------
We use Google Firebase as our backend service:
- Authentication: Handles secure user sign-in via Google.
- Firestore Database: A real-time database that stores Users, Chats, and Messages.
- Real-time Listeners: Updates the app instantly (live typing indicators, new message alerts).

4. Media Storage
--------------------------------------
- Cloudinary: Used as the external cloud storage for heavy media files.
  * Images and Voice Notes are uploaded here to keep the database fast.

5. Styling & Visuals
--------------------------------------
- CSS (Vanilla): Custom styling for the "Glassmorphism" effect, dark mode, and responsive layouts.
- Framer Motion: Powers the smooth animations throughout the app (Lamp pull, page transitions, chat bubbles).
- React Icons: Provides the vector icons (Send, Mic, Back arrow, etc.).

6. Key Features
--------------------------------------
- Voice Messaging: Custom implementation using the browser's MediaRecorder API to record and send audio.
- Mood Detection (AI): Analyzes message text to detect the mood (Happy, Serious, etc.) and changes UI hints accordingly.

7. Project Structure
--------------------------------------
- src/components/: visual parts (ChatRoom, Login (Lamp), Intro, etc).
- src/utils/: Helper functions (Cloudinary upload, Mood detector).
- src/context/: Global authentication state.
- firebase.js: Firebase configuration.
